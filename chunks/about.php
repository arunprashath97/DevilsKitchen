		        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Since our modest beginnings in 2015 with a little space in the heart of Kilinochchi, Devil's Kitchen's development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Sri-Lankan and Indian cuisines. In contrast to other South asian eateries, Devil's Kitchen was made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else. We realize numerous individuals love Sri-Lankan and Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run of the mill Indian nourishment taste so great. Our menu highlights things that utilize the sound and fragrant flavors.</p>
