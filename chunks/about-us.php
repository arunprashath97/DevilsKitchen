		        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Since our modest beginnings in 2015 with a little space in the heart of Kilinochchi, Devil's Kitchen's development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Sri-Lankan and Indian cuisines. In contrast to other South asian eateries, Devil's Kitchen was made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else. We realize numerous individuals love Sri-Lankan and Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run of the mill Indian nourishment taste so great. Our menu highlights things that utilize the sound and fragrant flavors. 
				
				Devil's Kitchen has developed to incorporate four superb takeout areas in Kilinochchi with additional to come sooner rather than later. Our group takes pride in the way that we can furnish our new and faithful clients with extraordinary tasting Indian-roused nourishment that is not normal for that at some other Indian eatery you visit. We perceive that a few people are as yet searching for the run of the mill Indian nourishment, and that is fine with us.</p>
